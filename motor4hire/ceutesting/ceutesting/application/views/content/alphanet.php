<h3>About Alpha-1</h3>
<p>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (Alpha-1) is one of the most common serious genetic disorders.  It is believed that only 6,000 of the estimated 100,000 Americans with Alpha-1 have been diagnosed to date.  An additional 21 million Americans are estimated to be genetic carriers of this order.  Alpha-1 is associated with liver disease in children and severe liver and lung disease in adults, presenting as early emphysema and cirrhosis.  Currently, the World Health Organization, the American Thoracic Society, and the European Respiratory Society recommend that all adults with the following conditions be tested for Alpha-1; COPD including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, chronic asthma, unexplained bronchiectasis, family history of Alpha-1 and chronic liver disease. </p>
